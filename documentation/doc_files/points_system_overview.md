# The Points System and You!

This is information on the Points System, Panda PTO, and how it operates. If you see behavior that is contrary to this document, please notify your Supervisor immediately.

## Points and How to Spend Them
You are provided with a bank of points - these points are yours to spend and can be spent in exchange for days off. Each day has a cost - this cost reflects the number of points that you will be charged in exchange for taking that day off.

#### New Hires
As a new hire, you won't be able to request days off for your first 90 days. If you need to take a day off, work with your Supervisor to find a possible solution.

## What Affects the Cost of a Day
### Initial Value
The initial value of a day is determined by the expected Case volume for that day and the number of Agents that are staffed for that day.

The higher the expected Cases Per Agent, the higher the initial cost for taking that day off. You can anticipate high cost days around traditionally heavy-traffic periods.

### 8/10 Hour Shifts
The cost of a day is different if you have an 8 hour shift or a 10 hour shift - the cost is 25% higher if you have a 10 hour shift compared to an 8 hour shift.

### Dynamic Value
As more people take a day off, the cost of that day will increase for future requests. The anticipated Cases Per Agent for that day is increasing and the cost will reflect that.

## Quarters and Banks
### Points Release
At the beginning of each quarter, 45 more points are released for 180 total points in a year. You can spend the points from any quarter at any time.

### Points Roll-Over
Unspent points roll into the next quarter. Points roll over from Quarter to Quarter but not from Year to Year. Your remaining quarterly balances are shown in the upper left corner of the Calendar.

#### New Hires
As a new hire, your points are pro-rated based on the day of the year that you were hired.

## What Prevents Days Off
You may not be able to create a new time off request for any of the following reasons:
1. You do not have enough points left in the quarter to take the day-off
2. You are on a PIP
3. You started less than 90 days ago
4. It is a  'day-of' requests (less then 24 hours warning).

If for any reason you need to take a day off but are unable to do so, your Supervisor has options to excuse or lower the cost of the request. Reach out to your Supervisor for possible alternatives.

If you do not have enough points for the day-off, you may need to complete a make-up day or there may be other consequences.
