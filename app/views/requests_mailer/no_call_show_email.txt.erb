Hi <%= @user.name %>,

On <%= @pto_request.request_date %>, a “no-call/no-show” day was added to your record.

You acquire a “no-call/no-show” day by not letting your Supervisor or MCO know within an hour of your shift starting that you will be late, or that you won’t be there at all that day.

As a reminder, if you accumulate two “no call, no show” days, your employment may be terminated. 

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact your supervisor.

Thank you,
Panda Admin
