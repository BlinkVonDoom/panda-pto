Hi <%= @user.name %>,

On <%= @pto_request.request_date %>, a “no-call/no-show” day was added to your record.

You acquire a “no-call/no-show” by failing to inform your Supervisor or MCO that you will be late or absent within the hour before your shift start time.

As a reminder, if you accumulate two “no call, no show” days, your employment may be terminated. 

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact your supervisor.

Thank you,
Panda Admin
