Hello <%= @agent.name%>,

This is a courtesy email to let you know you have less than 8 PTO credits in your account.  

To take a full day off, either sick or vacation, you will need to either wait until you are allotted more PTO credits (the beginning of every quarter), arrange a shift swap for the time not covered by your credits, or makeup the time not covered by your credits.

After your credits are used, you won’t be approved for any PTO and you’ll need to makeup any days missed until you have been allotted more credits.

Agent: <%= @agent.name %>
Remaining balances: <%= @agent.bank_value %>

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact your supervisor. 

Thank you, 
Panda Admin
